    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XX.&mdash;THE DIVORC&Eacute;E.</h3>

    <p>The Court over which Sir JAMES HANNEN presides was
    instituted for the purification of morals by the separation of
    ill-assorted couples. Matrimonial errors, which had hitherto
    stood upon the level of political grievances, capable of
    redress only after the careful and unbiassed attention of
    British legislators had been, at much expense both of time and
    money, devoted to them, were henceforth to form the subject of
    a special procedure in a division of the Courts of Law created
    for the purpose, and honestly calculated to bring separation
    and divorce within the reach even of the most modest incomes.
    The tyrant man, as usual, favoured himself by the rules he laid
    down for the playing of the game. For whereas infidelity on the
    part of the wife is held to be, in itself, a sufficient cause
    for pronouncing a decree in favour of the husband, a kind,
    though constantly unfaithful husband, is protected from
    divorce, and only punished by separation from the wife he has
    wronged. It is necessary for a man to add either cruelty or
    desertion to his other offence, in order that his wife may
    obtain from the laws of her country the opportunity of marrying
    someone else. But the wit of woman has proved equal to the
    emergency. Nowhere, it may be safely stated, have more tales of
    purely imaginative atrocity been listened to with greater
    attention, or with more favourable results, than in the Divorce
    Court. On an incautious handshake a sprained wrist and an arm
    bruised into all the colours of the rainbow have been not
    infrequently grafted. A British imprecation, and a banged door,
    have often become floods of invective and a knock-down blow;
    and a molehill of a pinch has, under favourable cultivation,
    been developed into a mountain of ill-treatment, on the top of
    which a victorious wife has in the end, triumphantly planted
    the banner of freedom.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Hence the Divorce Court, after some years of suspicion, has
    gradually come to be looked upon as one of the sacred
    institutions of the country. And, speaking generally, those who
    make use of its facilities, however much certain of the more
    strait-laced may frown, are considered by society at large to
    have done a thing which is surprisingly right and often
    enviable. The result at any rate is that the number of the
    divorced increases year by year, and that a lady whose failings
    have been established against her by a judicial decree, may be
    quite sure of a hand of ardent sympathisers of both sexes,
    amongst whom she can hold her head as high as her inclination
    prompts her without exciting a larger number of spiteful
    comments than are allotted to her immaculate and undecreed
    sisters. She may not have been able to abide the question of
    the Counsel who cross-examined her, but she is certainly free,
    even in a wider sense than before. She may not, perhaps, stand
    on so lofty a social pinnacle as the merely-separated lady
    whose husband still lives, and to whose male friends the fact
    that she in practically husbandless, and at the same time
    disabled from marriage, gives a delightful sense both of zest
    and security. On the other hand, the separated lady must be to
    a certain extent circumspect, lest she should place a weapon
    for further punishment in the hands of her husband. But to the
    Divorc&eacute;e all things apparently, are permitted.</p>

    <p>When she left the Court in which, to use her own words, "all
    her budding hopes had been crushed by the triumph of
    injustice," the beautiful Divorc&eacute;e (for in order to be
    truly typical the Divorc&eacute;e is necessarily beautiful)
    might have proceeded immediately to plant them afresh in the
    old soil. The various gentlemen who had sustained their
    reputation as men of honour by tampering on her behalf and on
    their own, with the strict letter of the truth, naturally felt
    that the boldness of their denials entitled them to her lasting
    regard, and showed themselves ready to aid her with their
    counsel. But, though she never ceased to protest her innocence
    of all that had been laid to her charge and proved against her,
    she was sufficiently sensible to give them to understand that
    for a time, at least, her path in the world would be easier if
    they ceased to accompany her. They accepted the sentence of
    banishment with a good grace, knowing perfectly well that it
    was not for long. The Divorc&eacute;e then withdrew from the
    flaming placards of the daily papers, on which she had figured
    during the past week, and betook herself to the seclusion of
    her bijou residence in the heart of the most fashionable
    quarter. Here she pondered for a short time upon the doubtful
    unkindness of fate which had deprived her of a husband whom she
    despised, and of a home which his presence had made
    insupportable. But she soon roused herself to face her new lack
    of responsibility, and to enjoy it. At first, she moved
    cautiously. There were numerous sympathisers who urged her to
    defy the world, such as it is, and to show herself everywhere
    entirely careless of what people might say. Such conduct might
    possibly have been successful, but the Divorc&eacute;e foresaw
    a possible risk to her reputation, and abstained. She began,
    therefore, by making her public appearances infrequent. In
    company with the devoted widow, whose evidence had almost saved
    her from an adverse verdict, she arranged placid tea-parties at
    which the casual observer might have imagined that the rules of
    social decorum were more strictly enforced than in the
    household of an archbishop. Inquiry, however, might have
    revealed the fact that a large proportion of the ladies present
    at these gatherings had either shaken off the matrimonial
    shackles, or proposed to do so, whether as plaintiffs or as
    defendants, whenever a favourable opportunity presented itself.
    The men, too, who were, after a time, admitted to these staid
    feasts, were not altogether archiepiscopal, though they behaved
    as they were dressed, quite irreproachably. To counter-balance
    them to some extent, the Divorc&eacute;e determined to secure
    the presence and the countenance of a clergyman.</p>

    <p>After some search, she discovered one who was enthusiastic,
    deficient in worldly knowledge, and susceptible. To him she
    related her own private version of her wrongs, which she
    seasoned with quite a pretty flow of tears. The amiable cleric
    yielded without a struggle, and readily placed at her service
    the protection of his white tie. Thus strengthened, she moved
    forward a little further. She revisited theatres; she was heard
    of at Clubs; she shone again at dinner-parties, and in a year
    or so had organised for herself a social circle which entirely
    satisfied her desires. Sometimes she even allowed herself to
    dabble in good works. She was accused of having written a
    religious poem for a serious Magazine; but all that was ever
    proved against her was, that a remarkable series of articles on
    <i>The Homes of the Poor</i> bore traces of a style that was
    said to be hers. Evil tongues still whispered in corners, and
    cynics were heard to scoff occasionally; but the larger world,
    which abhors cynics, and only believes what is good, began to
    smile upon her. She did not appear to value its
    smiles,&mdash;but they were useful. Whenever London tired her,
    she flitted to Paris, or to the Riviera, or even to Egypt or
    Algiers. She subscribed to charities, and acted in Amateur
    Theatricals. Finally, she married a gentleman who was believed
    by his friends to be a poet, and who certainly qualified for
    the title by the romance he had woven about her. With him she
    lived for many years a poetic and untrammelled existence, and,
    when she died, many dowagers sent wreaths as tokens of their
    sorrow at the loss of an admirable woman.</p>

    <h2>A LAMB-LIKE GAMBOL.</h2>

    <p>Some little time ago we noticed with great satisfaction,
    that the Committee of the Sunday School Union had advertised in
    the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for the "best Tale on Gambling," for
    which they were anxious to pay One Hundred Pounds sterling. The
    principal "condition" that the C.S.S.U. attached to their
    competition was that "the tale must be drawn as far as possible
    from actual life, and must vividly depict the evils of
    gambling, setting forth its ruinous effects sociably and
    morally on the young people of our land." Perhaps the following
    short story may serve as a model to the candidates. This
    romance must be considered "outside the competition." Here it
    is.</p>

    <h3>PLEASANT POVERTY BETTER THAN WICKED WEALTH!</h3>

    <p>PETER was a good boy. He went to Sunday school regularly,
    and always took off his hat to his superiors&mdash;he so
    objected to gambling that he never called them "betters." One
    day PETER found a sovereign, and fearing, lest it might be a
    gilded jubilee shilling, decided to spend it upon himself,
    rather than run the risk of possibly causing the Police to put
    it in circulation, under the impression that it was a coin of
    the higher value. He spent ten shillings on a ticket to
    Boulogne-sur-Mer, and with the remaining half-sovereign played
    at <i>Chemin de Fer</i> at the Casino. And, alas! this was his
    first straying from the path of virtue. Unfortunately he was
    most unlucky (from a moral point of view) in his venture,
    leaving the tables with a sum exceeding forty pounds. Feeling
    reluctant that money so ill-gained should remain for very long
    in his possession, he spent a large slice of it in securing a
    ticket for Monte Carlo.</p>

    <p>Arrived at this dreadful place he backed Zero fifteen times
    running, was unhappy enough to break the bank, and retired to
    rest with over ten thousand pounds. He now decided, that he had
    best return to England, where he felt sure he would be safe
    from further temptation.</p>

    <p>When he was once more in London, he could not make up his
    mind whether he should contribute his greatly scorned fortune
    to the Committee of the Sunday School Union, or plank his last
    dollar on a rank outsider for a place in the Derby. From a
    feeling of delicacy, he adopted the latter course, and was
    indescribably shocked to pull off his fancy at Epsom. Thinking
    that the Committee of the same useful body would refuse to
    receive money obtained under such painful circumstances, he
    plunged deeply on the Stock Exchange, and again added
    considerably to his much-hated store. It was at this period in
    his history that he married, and then the punishment he had so
    justly merited overtook him. His wife was a pushing young
    woman, whose great delight was to see her name in the Society
    papers. This pleasure she managed to secure by taking a large
    house, and giving costly entertainments to all sorts and
    conditions of individuals. Poor PETER soon found this mode of
    life intolerably wearisome. He now never knew an hour's peace,
    until one day he determined to run away from home, leaving in
    the hands of his wife all that he possessed. His absence made
    no perceptible difference in Mrs. PETER's <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.
    It was generally supposed that he was living abroad. However,
    on one winter night there was a large gathering at his wife's
    house, and, it being very cold, the guests eagerly availed
    themselves of the services of the linkman, who had told himself
    off to fetch their carriages.</p>

    <p>And, when everyone was gone, the poor linkman asked the
    mistress of the house for some broken victuals.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed that Lady, "if it isn't my
    husband! What do you mean, PETER, by so disgracing me?"</p>

    <p>"Disgrace you!&mdash;not I!" returned PETER. "No one
    recognises me. Of all the guests that throng my house, and eat
    my suppers, I don't believe there is a solitary individual who
    knows me by sight."</p>

    <p>And PETER was right. Ah, how much better would it have been

    <h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

    <p>OSTRICH "FARMING."&mdash;We are afraid we cannot give you
    any sound or useful information to assist you in your project
    of keeping an ostrich-farm in a retired street in Bayswater;
    but that you should have already received a consignment of
    fifty "fine, full-grown birds," and managed, with the aid of
    five railway porters, and all the local police available, to
    get them from the van in which they arrived up two flights of
    stairs, and locate them temporarily in your back drawing-room,
    augurs at least for a good start to your undertaking. That
    three should have escaped, and, after severely kicking the
    Vicar, who happened to be dining with you, terrified the whole
    neighbourhood, and effected an entrance into an adjacent
    public-house, where they appear to have done a good deal of
    damage to the glass and crockery, upsetting a ten-gallon cask
    of gin, and frightening the barmaid into a fit of hysterics,
    being only finally captured by the device of getting a
    coal-sack over their heads, was, after all, but a slight
    <i>contretemps</i>, and not one to be taken into account when
    measured against the grand fact that you have got <i>all your
    birds safely lodged for the night</i>. A little arnica, and a
    fortnight in bed, will, in all probability, set the Vicar all
    right. With regard to their food, we should advise you to
    continue the tinned lobster and muffins, which they seem to
    relish. You appear to be alarmed at their swallowing the tins.
    There is no occasion for any anxiety on this point, the tin,
    doubtless, serving as the proverbial "digestive" pebble with
    which all birds, we believe, accompany a hearty meal. We fear
    we cannot enlighten you as to how you make your profits out of
    an ostrich-farm; but, speaking at random, we should say they
    would probably arise by pulling the feathers out of the tails
    of the birds and selling them to Court Milliners. Your idea of
    trying them in harness in a Hansom seems to have something in
    it. Turn it over, by all means. Meantime, get a Shilling
    Handbook on the Management of the Ostrich. We think you will
    have to cover in your garden with a tarpaulin as you suggest.
    You cannot expect the fifty birds to stay for ever in your back
    drawing-room; and the fact that you mention, of their having
    already kicked down and eaten one folding-door, is significant.
    They will be escaping from your balcony all over the
    neighbourhood if you do not take care to secure them; and as
    they seem fresh, very aggressive, and strong in the leg, such a
    catastrophe might lead you into a good deal of unpleasantness.
    Take our advice, and get them downstairs, tight under a stout
    tarpaulin, as soon as possible.</p>

    it. <i>I've</i> nothing to do with it, one way or another,
    except to see the law carried out.</p>

    want to, we may as well step over to the "Crown and Thistle,"
    and&mdash;</p>

    this wall is properly underpinned?</p>

    <p><i>Builder</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Well&mdash;er&mdash;not
    exackly&mdash;but, 'er, 'er&mdash;well, the fact is I
    thought&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Surveyor</i> (<i>sternly</i>). What you <i>thought</i>,
    Sir, doesn't affect the matter. The question is, what the
    Building Act <i>says</i>. The whole thing must come down!</p>

    <p><i>Builder</i>. But, I say, that'll run me into ten pounds,
    at least, and really the thing's as safe as&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Surveyor</i>. Maybe, maybe&mdash;in fact, I don't say it
    isn't. But the Act says it's got to be done.</p>

    <p><i>Builder</i>. Well, well, if there's no help for it, I
    must <i>do</i> it, of course.</p>

    <p><i>Surveyor</i> (<i>looking somehow disappointed</i>). Very

        Heidsieck, and smokes a cigar of full size and flavour. He

        devices for "dodging the Act," &amp;c., &amp;c.</i>
        Surveyor <i>explains how stubborn builders ("not like</i>

        suffer by having to run themselves to expenses that might
        have been avoided&mdash;and serve 'em right too! Also, how
        others, without a temper above "tips," and of a generally
        gentlemanly tone of mind, save themselves lots of little

        get over, "and no harm done, neither, to nobody." As the

    and a better bit of building than yours yonder I haven't seen
    for some time. Seems a pity, hanged if it don't, that you
    should have to put yourself to such an additional
    outlay&mdash;ah, by the way, <i>what</i> did you say it would

    <h2>STRANGER THAN FICTION!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Postmarks&mdash;Leeds, Hull, and Elsewhere.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Mr. Punch was assisting at a Congress. The large room in
    which that Congress was being held was crowded, and
    consequently the heat was oppressive. The speeches, too, were
    not particularly interesting, and the Sage became drowsy. It
    was fortunate, therefore, that a fair maiden in a classical
    garb (who suddenly appeared seated beside him) should have
    addressed him. The interruption reassembled in their proper
    home his wandering senses.</p>

    <p>"I fear, <i>Mr. Punch</i>," said the fair maiden, looking at
    herself in a small mirror which she was holding in her right
    hand, "that you are inclined to go to sleep."</p>

    <p>"Well, I am," replied the Sage, with unaccountable
    bluntness; "truth to tell, these orations about nothing in
    particular, spouted by persons with an imperfect knowledge of,
    I should say, almost any subject, bore me."</p>

    <p>"The information is unnecessary," observed the young lady;
    with a smile. "I share your feelings. But if you will be so
    kind as to pay a little attention to the speakers while they
    are under my influence, I think you will discover a new
    interest in their utterances."</p>

    <p>"Are you an hypnotist, Madam?" asked <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

    <p>"Well, not exactly. But, when I have the chance, I can make
    people speak the Truth."</p>

    <p>Then <i>Mr. Punch</i> listened, and was surprised at the
    strange things that next happened.</p>

    <p>"I wish to be perfectly frank with you," said a gentleman on
    the platform; "I am here because I wish to see my name in the
    papers, and all the observations I have made up to date have
    been addressed to the reporters. I am glad I can control my
    thoughts, because I would not for worlds let you know the
    truth. It is my ambition to figure as a philanthropist, and on
    my word, I think this is the cheapest and most effective mode
    of carrying out my intention."</p>

    <p>Then the gentleman resumed his seat with a smile that
    suggested that he was under the impression that he had just
    delivered himself of sentiments bound to extort universal
    admiration.</p>

    <p>"That is not exactly my case," observed a second speaker,
    "because I do not care two pins for anything save the
    entertainments which are invariably associated with scientific
    research, or philanthropical inquiry. I pay my guinea, after
    considerable delay, and then expect to take out five times that
    amount in grudgingly bestowed, but competitionally provoked (if
    I may be pardoned the expression) hospitality. I attend a
    portion&mdash;a small portion&mdash;of a lecture, and then
    hurry off to the nearest free luncheon, or gratuitous dinner,
    in the neighbourhood. I should be a tax upon my friends if I
    dropped in at half-past one, or at a quarter to eight,
    punctually, and my motives would be too wisely interpreted to a
    desire on my part to reduce the sum total of my butcher's book.
    So I merely drop in upon a place where a Congress is being
    held, and make the most of my membership."</p>

    <p>"These startling statements are decidedly unconventional,"
    said <i>Mr. Punch</i>, turning towards his fair companion, "and
    that your influence should cause them to be made, astounds me.
    I trust you will not consider me indiscreet if I ask
    for&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"My name and address," returned the fair maiden, smilingly,
    completing the sentence; "Learn, then, that I live at the
    bottom of a well, to which rather damp resting-place I am about
    to return; and that in England I am called Truth."</p>

    <p>And as the lady disappeared, <i>Mr. Punch</i> fell from his
    chair, and awoke!</p>

    <p>"Dear me, I have been dreaming!" exclaimed the Sage, as he
    left the meeting. "Well, as everyone knows, dreams are not in
    the least like reality! But the strangest thing of all was to
    find Truth in a Congress!"</p>

    <p>And it was strange, indeed.</p>

    <h2>AT THE THEATRE!</h2>

    <h4><i>The Lyceum again. The Haymarket once more.</i></h4>

    <p>"Great Scott!" we exclaim,&mdash;not Critical CLEMENT of
    that ilk, but Sir WALTER,&mdash;on again seeing
    <i>Ravenswood</i>. Since then an alteration in the <i>modus
    shootendi</i> has been made, and <i>Edgar</i> no longer takes a
    pot-shot at the bull from the window, but, ascertaining from
    <i>Sir William Ashton Bishop</i> that <i>Ellen Lucy Terry</i>
    is being Terryfied by an Irish bull which has got mixed up with
    the Scotch "herd without," <i>Henry Edgar Irving</i> rushes
    off, gun in hand; then the report of the gun is, like the
    Scotch oxen, also "<i>heard</i> without," and <i>Henry</i>
    reappears on the scene, having saved <i>Ellen Lucy Ashton</i>
    by reducing the fierce bull to potted beef.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"What shall he have who kills the bull?" "The Dear! the
    Dear!" meaning, of course, <i>Ellen Lucy Ashton</i> aforesaid.
    After this all goes well. Acting excellent all round&mdash;or
    nearly all round, the one exception being, however, the very
    much "all-round" representative of <i>Lady Ashton</i>, whose
    misfortune it is to have been selected for this particular
    part. Scenery lovely, and again and again must HAWES MCCHAVEN
    be congratulated on the beautiful scene of The Mermaiden's Well
    (never better, in fact), Act III. The love-making bit in this
    Act is charming, and the classic Sibyl, <i>Ailsie</i>, superb.
    Nothing in stage effect within our memory has equalled the
    pathos of the final <i>tableau</i>. It is most touching through
    its extreme simplicity.</p>

    <p>The Haymarket has re-opened with the odd mixture of the
    excellent French <i>Abb&eacute; Constantin</i> and the weak,
    muddle-headed, Tree-and-Grundy-ised "village Priest," known as
    the <i>Abb&eacute; Dubois</i>, or "<i>Abb&eacute; Do Bore</i>,"
    as 'ARRY might call him. Changes are in contemplation, and may
    have been already announced. Whatever they may be, it is some
    consolation to learn that this Tree-and-Grundy-ised French
    Abb&eacute; is not likely to be a "perpetual Curate."</p>

    sun. I made haste, for there was fear in the air, Sahib, and
    the <i>Pleez Mahn</i> that walketh by night was upon me. But,
    oh, Sahib, the cunning of the serpent was with me, and as he
    passed I tripped him up, and the raging river received him.
    Twice he rose, and the gleam of his eyes spake in vain for
    help. And at last there came a bubble where the man had been,
    and he was seen no more. <i>Burra Murra Boko! Burra Murra

    <p>That night I spake unto her as she stood in the moonlight.
    "Oh, sister of an oil-jar, and daughter of pig-troughs, what is
    it thou hast done?" And she, laughing, spake naught in reply,
    but gave me the <i>Tcheke Slahp</i> of her tribe, and her
    fingers fell upon my face, and my teeth rattled within my
    mouth. But I, for my blood was made hot within me, sped swiftly
    from her, making no halt, and the noise of fifty thousand
    devils was in my ears, and the rage of the <i>Sm&acirc;k

    was as a fresh fig that grows upon a southern wall.

    like unto a <i>Brerra-bit</i>, lay low, and my breath came
    softly, and they knew not that I watched them as they spake.
    And they joked much together, and told each to the other how
    that the wives of their friends were to them as mice in the
    sight of the crouching <i>Tabbikat</i>, and that the honour of
    a man was as sand, that is blown afar by the storm-wind of the
    desert, which maketh blind the faithful, and stoppeth their

    of champagne that I always carried in my coat-tail pockets
    whenever I went up to the Barracks to visit my friend O'RAMMIS,
    "very well. Fire away, TERENCE, and let us have your
    story."</p>

    <p>"I'm an ould fool," continued O'RAMMIS, in a convinced tone.
    "But ye know, JOCK, how 'twas. I misremember fwhat I said to

    got her left fut on the beat. 'That's quare,' thinks I to
    myself; 'but, TERENCE, me bhoy, 'tis you know the thricks av
    the women. Shoulder arrums,' I thinks, 'and let fly wid the
    back sight.' Wid that I just squeezed her hand wid the most
    dellikit av all squeezings, and, sez I, 'MARY, me darlint,' I
    sez, 'ye're not vexed wid TERENCE, I know;' but you never can

    <p>"Really, O'RAMMIS," I ventured to observe, for I noticed
    that he and his two friends had pulled all the other five
    bottles out of my pocket, and had finished them, "I'm a little
    disappointed with you to-day. I came out here for a little
    quiet blood-and-thunder before going to bed, and you are mixing
    up your stories like the regimental laundress's soapsuds. It's
    not right of you. Now, honestly, is it?"</p>

    <p>But the Three Musketeers had vanished. Perhaps they may
    reappear, bound in blue-grey on the railway bookstalls. Perhaps
    not. And the worst of it is, that the Colonel will never
    understand them, and the gentlemen who write articles will
    never understand them. There is only one man who knows all
    about them, and even he is sometimes what my friend O'RAMMIS
    calls "a blandandhering, philandhering, misundherstandhering
    civilian man."</p>

    <h2>"YE GODS, WHAT A TERRIBLE TWIST!"</h2>

    <p>Statistics are sweet things, and full of startling
    surprises. Like the Frenchman in "<i>Killaloe</i>" "you never
    know what they'll be up to next." Here, for instance, is a
    "statement showing the decrease in price in the United States
    of many articles within the past ten years <i>largely
    consumed</i> by the agricultural community." And among these
    "many articles" "largely consumed," are "mowing machines, barb
    fence-wire, horseshoes, forks, wire-cloth, slop-buckets,
    wheelbarrows, and putty." No wonder dyspepsia is the national
    disease in America. Fancy "consuming" French staples,
    pie-plates (though <i>they</i> sound almost edible), and
    putty!!! The ostrich is supposed to be capable of digesting
    such dainties as broken bottles, and tenpenny nails, but that
    voracious fowl is evidently not "in it" with the "Agricultural
    community" of America.</p>

    <p>ODD.&mdash;A Correspondent says he found this advertisement
    in the <i>Guardian</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>RECTOR of S. Michael's, Lichfield, requires help of a
        LAY-READER. Visiting, S.-school, cottage services, ass. in
        choir, &amp;c. Good salary.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The explanation, we believe, is, that "ass." is the
    abbreviated form of "assisting." The Rector had better have the
    unabbreviated assistant in choir, particularly if he be already
    short of choristers; unless the Rector should be also Vicar of
    Bray, in which case the "ass." could be transferred from
    Lichfield to the more appropriate living.</p>

    <h2>JOURNAL OF A ROLLING STONE.</h2>

    <h3>SEVENTH ENTRY.</h3>

    <p>To my intense surprise&mdash;shared, as far as I can see, by
    all my friends and relatives&mdash;I have managed to pass the
    "Bar Final"! I attribute the portentous fact to the Examiners
    having discreetly avoided all reference to the "Rule in
    SHELLEY's Case."</p>

    <p>Find that the Students who are going to be "called within
    the Bar," have to be presented to the Benchers on one special
    evening, after dinner, in Hall. Ceremony rather funereal, at
    <i>my</i> Inn&mdash;but not the same at all Inns. About twenty
    of us summoned one by one to the High Table; several go up
    before me, and as there is a big screen I can't see what
    happens to them. Only&mdash;most remarkable circumstance
    this&mdash;<i>not one of them comes back</i>! Have the Benchers
    decided to sternly limit the numbers of the Profession? Perhaps
    they are "putting in an execution." Just thinking of escape,
    when my name called out. March up to Table, determined not to
    perish without a spirited resistance.</p>

    <p>To complete the idea of its being an Execution, here is the
    Chaplain! Will he say a "few last words" to the
    culprit&mdash;myself&mdash;prior to my being pinioned?</p>

    <p>As matter of fact, Bencher at head of Table (portly old
    gentleman, who looks as if he might be described as a
    "bottle-a-day-of-port-ly" old gentleman) shakes hands, coldly,
    and that's all. Not even a Queen's Shilling given me, as I am
    conducted off to another table close by.</p>

    <p>Mystery of disappearance of other candidates explained. Here
    they are&mdash;all at this table&mdash;"all silent, and all
    called"! It seems that this is the Barristers' part of the
    Hall, other the Students'.</p>

    <p>Ceremony not over yet. After dinner we are invited, all
    twenty, to dessert and wine with the Benchers&mdash;or rather,
    at the Benchers' expense, because we don't really see and chat
    with these great men, only a single representative, who
    presides at table in a long bare room downstairs, resembling a
    cellar. Benchers' own Common-room above. Why don't they invite
    us up there? Bencher, who has come down to preside over this
    entertainment, has a rather forbidding air about him. Seems to
    be thinking&mdash;"I don't care much for this sort of function.
    Stupid old custom. But must keep it up, I suppose, for good of
    Inn; and Benchers (hang them!) have deputed <i>me</i> to take
    head of the table to-night&mdash;probably because I look so
    desperately lively."</p>

    <p>There <i>is</i> a sort of "disinterred liveliness" (to quote
    Bishop WILBERFORCE) about him, after all. Tries to joke. No
    doubt regards us all as a pack of fools to join over-crowded
    profession&mdash;still, as we <i>are</i> here, he will try and
    forget that, in a few years, the majority of us will probably
    be starving.</p>

    <p>After an interval, Bored Bencher thinks it necessary to rise
    and make little speech. Assures us
    (<i>Query</i>&mdash;hyprocrisy?) that we are all extremely
    likely to attain to high positions at the Bar. Says something
    feebly humorous about Woolsack. Bad taste, because we can't
    <i>all</i> sit on Woolsack at once; and mention of it excites
    feelings of emulation, almost of animosity, towards other
    new-fledged Barristers. I am conscious, for instance, of
    distinct repulsion towards man on my right, who is cracking
    nuts, and who must be a son or nephew of our Chairman, judging
    by the familiarity with which he treats latter. Probably his
    uncle will flood him with briefs&mdash;and that will be called
    "making his own way in the world." Pshaw!</p>

    <p>Wine-and-dessert entertainment only lasts an hour.
    Forbidding Bencher evidently feels that an hour is as much as
    he can possibly stand. So we all depart, except the favoured
    nephew (or son), who, as I suspect, "remains to prey" on his
    uncle (or father), and probably to be invited in to the
    <i>real</i> feast which no doubt the Inn worthies are enjoying
    upstairs.</p>

    <p>Next morning meet a legal friend, who asks, "When are you to
    be presented at Court?"</p>

    <p>"Presented at Court?"&mdash;I ask in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;Court of Queen's Bench&mdash;ha! ha! You'll have
    to go one of these days in wig and gown to the Q.B.D., and
    inscribe your name in a big book, and bow to the Judges, and
    come out."</p>

    <p>"What's the good of doing that?" I want to know.</p>

    <p>"None whatever. An old custom, that's all. A sort of legal
    fiction, you know." (<i>Query</i>&mdash;If a Queen's Counsel
    writes a novel, isn't <i>that</i> a real legal fiction?)
    "You'll feel rather like a little boy going to a new school.
    Judges look at you with an air of 'I say, you new feller,
    what's your name? Where do you come from? What House are you
    in?&mdash;then a good kick. They can't kick you, so they glare
    at you instead. Interesting ceremony. Ta, ta!"</p>

    <p>It turns out as my friend says. But previously there is the
    other little formality of purchasing the trailing garments of
    the Profession. Go to a wig-and-gown-maker near the Law Courts.
    Ask to see different kinds of wigs.</p>

    <p>"We only make one kind," replies the wig-man, pityingly.
    "The Patent Ventilating Anticalvitium. You'll find it as light
    as a feather, almost. Made of superfine 'orse-'air." He says
    this as if he never got his material from anything below the
    value of a Derby Winner.</p>

    <p>"Why do you call it the Anticalvitium?" I ask.</p>

    <p>"Because it don't make the 'air fall off, Sir, as all other
    wigs do."</p>

    <p>Do they? Another objection to the profession. Wish I had
    known this before I began to grind for the Bar Exam. Wig-man
    measures my head.</p>

    <p>"Rather large size, Sir," he remarks. Says it as if I must
    have water on the brain at the very least. "Middle Temple, I
    suppose?"&mdash;he queries. Why? Somehow it would <i>sound</i>
    more flattering if he had supposed Inner Temple, instead of
    Middle. Wonder if I shall ever be described as an "Outer
    barrister, of the Inner Temple, with Middling abilities." Is
    there a special cut of face belonging to the Inner Temple,
    another for the Middle (there <i>is</i> a "middle cut" in
    salmon, why not in the law?) and a third for Lincoln's Inn?</p>

    <p>Find, while I am meditating these problems, that I have been
    "suited" with a gown, also with a stock of ridiculous little
    linen flaps, which are called "bands." Think about "forbidding
    the bands," but don't know how to.</p>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of what may happen some day in George Street,

    <p>There were a few minutes unoccupied before the time
    appointed for the ceremony, and so the Pew-opener thought he
    could not do better than point out the many excellences of the
    church to the Bridegroom.</p>

    <p>"You see, Sir," he said, "our pulpit is occupied by the best
    possible talent. The Vicar takes the greatest interest in
    securing every rising preacher, and thus, Sunday after Sunday,
    we have the most startling orations."</p>

    <p>The Bridegroom (slightly bored) said that if he had happened
    to live in the neighbourhood, he should certainly have taken
    sittings.</p>

    <p>"But living in the neighbourhood is not necessary, Sir,"
    persisted the Pew-opener. "Let into the sounding-board is a
    telephone, and so our Vicar can supply the sermons preached
    here, hot and hot, to residents in the London Postal District.
    Considering the quality of the discourses, he charges a very
    low rate. The system has been largely adopted. As a matter of
    fact the whole service, and not only the pulpit, has been laid
    on to the principal Hotels and Clubs."</p>

    <p>But further conversation was here cut short by the arrival
    of the Bride, who, led by her brother, advanced towards the
    altar with an air of confidence that charmed all beholders.
    This self-possession was the outcome of the lady being&mdash;as
    her grey moir&eacute;-antique indicated&mdash;a widow.
    Congratulations passed round amongst the friends and relatives,
    and then the bridal party was arranged in front of the good old
    Vicar.</p>

    <p>"Have you switched us on?" said he to the Clerk.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," was the reply. "We are now in communication with
    all the principal Hotels and Clubs."</p>

    <p>"That's right. I am always anxious that my clients shall
    have their full money's-worth." And then the Vicar read with
    much emphasis the exhortation to the public to declare any
    "just cause or impediment" to the marriage. Naturally there was
    no response, and an opening hymn was sung by the choir, which,
    containing some half-dozen verses, lasted quite a quarter of an
    hour. At its conclusion the Vicar, who had allowed his
    attention to become distracted, instead of going on with the
    service, again read the exhortation. He once more gave the
    names of "HARRY SMITH, bachelor," and "AMY JONES, widow."</p>

    <p>"If anyone knows any just cause or impediment," he
    continued.</p>

    <p>"Stop; I do!" interrupted a gentleman in a dressing-gown,
    who had hurriedly entered the Church. "I heard you about a
    quarter of an hour ago, while I was breakfasting at the
    Shaftesbury Avenue Hotel, ask the same question, and came here
    without changing my coat. Very sorry to interrupt the ceremony,
    but this lady is my wife! Well, AMY, how are you?"</p>

    <p>"What, JOEY!" exclaimed the (now) ex-Bride, delightedly. "We
    <i>are</i> glad to see you! We thought you were dead!"</p>

    <p>Then the gentleman in the dressing-gown was heartily greeted
    on all sides. He seemed to be a very popular personage.</p>

    <p>"But where do I come in?" asked Mr. BROWN, the
    ex-Bridegroom, who had, during this scene, shown signs of
    embarrassment.</p>

    <p>"O JOEY, I quite forgot to introduce you to HARRY," said the
    ex-Bride. "You must know one another. I was going to marry him
    when you, darling, turned up just in the nick of time, like a
    dear good old boy!"</p>

    <p>"Delighted to make your acquaintance, Sir," said Mr. JONES,
    shaking Mr. BROWN warmly by the hand. "And now I must go back
    to finish my breakfast!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, with me," said the ex-Bride. "You must sit, darling,
    in the seat intended for poor HARRY. I know you won't mind,
    HARRY (or, perhaps, I ought to call you Mr. BROWN now?), as I
    have <i>so</i> much to say to dear JOEY. And you can have your
    breakfast at a side-table&mdash;now won't you, just to please
    me? You always are <i>so</i> kind and considerate!"</p>

    <p>And, as the wedding-party left the Church, the Clerk hastily
    unswitched the electric communication.</p>

    <p>"Be quiet, Sir!" he whispered, sternly, to Mr. BROWN, who
    had been talking to himself. "If our clients heard you, we
    should be ruined! We guarantee that our telephonic supply shall
    be perfectly free from bad language!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>PROPHET AND LOSS.&mdash;Good Mussulmen, so it is said,
    object to a play entitled <i>Mahomet</i> being produced in
    London. The objection was successful in Paris. London Managers
    (except, perhaps, Sheriff DRURIOLANUS, who revived <i>Le
    Prophete</i> this season) will be on the side of the objectors,
    as they would rather have to do with a genuine profit than a
    fictitious one. Perhaps the non-production of <i>Mahomet</i>
    may be a loss to Literature and the Drama.</p>

    <blockquote>

        Banff, to Mr. THOMAS ADAM, Deputy Chairman of the Great
        North of Scotland Railway Company."</p>

    <p>The Baron must say a word about <i>Voces Populi</i>, by F.
    ANSTEY, author of the immortal <i>Vice Vers&acirc;</i>. That
    the series contained in this volume appeared in <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> pages is sufficient guarantee for the excellence of
    its quality, and more than this it would not become the Baron
    to say; but of the illustrations by J. BERNARD PARTRIDGE the
    Baron can speak&mdash;and speak in terms of the highest
    admiration of them&mdash;as works of genuinely artistic humour.
    There are twenty illustrations, that is, ten brace of
    Partridges, if he will allow the Baron so far to make game of
    him. The book is published by LONGMANS, GREEN &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>The Leadenhall Press has brought out, in Pocket form,
    <i>Prince Dorus</i>, by CHARLES LAMB, with nine coloured
    illustrations, following the original Edition of 1811. The
    lines are not very Lamb-like, but the illustrations are very
    quaint, and the Pocket Volume is a curiosity of literature.</p>

    <h2>A REALLY VALUABLE SUGGESTION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>To the Editor of Punch.</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;As the conductor of the recognised organ of
    the legal profession, I have the honour to address you. My
    learned and accomplished friend. Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS, Q.C.,
    complained the other day that there was a right of appeal from
    the Police Court to the Bench of Middlesex Magistrates. He said
    that his colleagues were barristers and gentlemen of
    considerable eminence, and in those characters were better able
    to decide upon the merits of a case than the persons who
    compose the Tribunal to which appeal from their decision is
    permissible. I have not recently looked through the list of
    Metropolitan Police Magistrates, but, if they have been chosen
    from the ranks of literature and law, as they were thirty years
    ago, I can well understand that they are an exceedingly capable
    body of men. That so accomplished a <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>
    and admirable an advocate as my friend Mr. MONTAGU WILLIAMS
    himself should have been raised to the Magisterial bench, is a
    proof that the standard has been maintained. But, Sir, can
    nothing be done for the other tribunal?</p>

    <p>Would it not be possible to appoint a certain proportion of
    stipendiaries, with ample salaries, to that body? What is
    wanted are men with a perfect knowledge of the law, and a large
    experience of the adversities as well as the pleasures of life.
    If they occasionally dabble in literature, so much the better.
    But, it may be said, where are such men to be found? I answer,
    in very many places, and, to encourage the authorities in their
    search, shall be most happy to personally head the list.</p>

    <p>Yours, very faithfully,</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>) A. BRIEFLESS, JUNIOR. <i>Pump-handle Court,
    Oct. 4th, 1890.</i></p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
